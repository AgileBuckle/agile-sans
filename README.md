# Agile Sans
Agile Sans is a font primarily developed off the handwriting of Agile. This font was created using [Handwrite](https://github.com/builtree/handwrite) and then edited in [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/). Feel free to contribute to this font.
## Contributing
All I ask is that any changes you make to this font be uploaded back to this GitHub repo. All changes are welcome as long as the orignal essence of the font is kept. At this point these are the following goals...
- [ ] Fix kerning and other character spacing.
- [ ] Make the characters more rounded and even.
- [ ] Expand the glyph set.
- [ ] Make the font variable in weight and spacing. (This is a long time goal)
